I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economic History at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en). My dissertation project titled "**Occupational structure and skill distribution in Sweden, 1870 - 1970**" looks into the effects that industrialization had on the occupations and skills of the Swedish labor force.

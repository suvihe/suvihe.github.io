I am a Ph.D. student in the Unit of Economic History at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/school-business-economics-law/economy-society/about-us/our-units/unit-for-economic-history). My dissertation project titled "**Technological change, skills, and occupational structure in Sweden, 1870 - 1950**" looks into how technological change has influenced employment and skills during industrialization in Sweden. My supervisor is [Svante Prado](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/svantelarsson).

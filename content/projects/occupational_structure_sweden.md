### Summary

This project examines the occupational structure and skill composition in Sweden during its rapid industrialization phase from 1870s onward. More specifically, it aims to find evidence of skill-biased or task-biased technological change, and whether the changes in skill composition resulted in changes in income inequality among workers. Furthermore, the project aims to account for differential regional outcomes, migration, and the supply of skilled workers during the period under study.
